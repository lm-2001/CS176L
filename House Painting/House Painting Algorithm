Input:

1. Input cost per square foot, stored as sqftCost
2. Input and store height (houseHeight), width (houseWidth) and length (houseLength) of
house
3. Input and store width (doorWidth), length (doorLength), and number (doorNum) of
doors
4. Input number of windows (windowNum), the length (windowLength), and width
(windowWidth)


Calculations:

1. Calculate the total for the windows
  a. windowTotal = windowLength * windowWidth * windowNum 
  
2. Calculate the total for the doors
  a. doorTotal = doorWidth * doorLength * doorNum
  
3. Calculate the total for the house and store as houseTotal
  a. 1/2 + (houseLength * (houseHeight-houseWidth))+ 2 * (houseLength * houseWidth)+(houseLength * houseWidth) * 2
  
4. Add doorTotal to windowTotal, then subtract from houseTotal. Store as sqFt 
  a. sqFt = (houseTotal - (windowTotal + doorTotal))

5. Multiply sqFt by sqftCost to get the final estimate. Store as estimate
  a. estimate = sqftCost * sqFt
  

Output:

1. Print total paintable surface area (sqFt)
2. Print final estimate (estimate)
